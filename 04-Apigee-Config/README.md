# Apigee Proxy Configurations

This folder contains all Apigee API proxy bundles for the demo applications in `01-Demo-Services`.

- Each subfolder matches an application or use-case.
- Deploy proxies using Apigee UI, CLI, or automation.

**Note:** The NGINX example does not require Apigee proxy configuration.
